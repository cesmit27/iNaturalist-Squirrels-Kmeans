This is the code and output for 3 different squirrel species living in California. The Eastern Gray and Fox squirrels are introduced, and the Western Gray squirrel is a native species.
The squirrel observation data is sourced from iNaturalist.
The goal of this is to see if the native species might be getting outcompeted byt the introduced species, and it looks like it might be since there are so many Fox Squirrels.
I also did this to help learn how to use python, including learning how to use matplotlib and pandas, but this is a small piece of a larger project that uses ESRI's ArcGIS Pro. 
If I end up coding my analysis in there using the arcpy library or using jupyter (unlikely since I have no clue how to use jupyter) I will update this repository with those .py files
